                    I am a student of the Universidad del Norte, studying Software Engineering. I am currently in my 9th semester, trying to build and strength my portfolio and technical knowledge. I am passionate about technology and how together we can build social solutions to help people. Making a positive impact on society is my main goal.
                    <br>
                    I am a very organized, responsabile, result-driven, passionate, resourceful and kind person. I love to work in a team in which we can share ideas and learn from each other.
                    <br>
                    Always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a person. I believe that constant learning is the key to success and I am willing to take daily steps to improve and be a better self. Committed to learning and self-development.
                    <br>
                    I am looking for an opportunity to use technical and no-technical skills in a challenging working environment.
                    <br>
                    In the future I see myself working in a company that is committed to social responsibility and that is looking to make a positive impact on society. Leading projects and teams to achieve the company's goals.
